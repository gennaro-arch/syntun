This is deprecated, python performs poorly and with just 100 lines I created a simple and extremly fast (same as udp) syn/syn-ack proxy in Golang meant to be used with a vpn. Search for it.

I created it because it bypass all mobile carriers' firewalls even when you don't have a balance or an internet plan. Unfortunatly to make those strange packets it uses raw sockets and in Android you need root access for that, but it works.
